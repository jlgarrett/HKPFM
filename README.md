# HKPFM
Hi,

This is some old code to run H-KPFM on a Cypher microscope. It was witten during my PhD and I have not updated it since. However, I have had a request for some of the code from that project, so I thought that I would put it up here to share it. Note that I have access to neither Igor Pro nor a Cypher microscope, so I am unable to troubleshoot this currently. 

The how-to for this code is descibed in [the appendix of my thesis](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2013131578?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). 

One way to test and see if you have managed to get the code to work on your machine is to try the experiments in https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02503 . 

I believe the code can also handle the 'harmonic mixing'-KPFM that I describe in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.8b08097 . 

I recommend using the settings that are used in https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023355 . They make scanning much easier, if a bit slower, particularly for rough surfaces, for reasons descibed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05736.pdf .

I'd be interested in finding someone else to take over maintenance of this code.
